# readme for UI coding

## UI

- Web UI
  
  If you access a website, you are visiting a web UI.
  
- Mobile UI
  
  The apps in your mobile phone are using mobile UI. iphone app and android app are quit differenct UIs. They are using diff languages, toolsets, and UI controls.

  Both of them are using webview control, which is a tiny browser to show a webpage. Now it goes back to web UI!
  
- (desctop) UI
  
  Most application of windows or linux are using this kind of UI. It is traditional UI, high performance (than web UI), but can be only accessed locally (comparing with web UI).

  One typical exception is VSCode, if you hear of it. It is mainly a web UI running inner a framework (think of the framework as a browser). Chatgpt more on this if you are intrested in. The benefit of this arch is VSCode can be easily running in browser using a BS arch. 

## Browser-Server arch

A.k.a. BS arch. Use browser to visit the remote server. Front-end dev means to develope those codes/tags inner the browser. Back-end dev means to develope those codes running on the server. 

## back-end dev

In short, python, c/c++, Java and most languages are suitable for server-side dev. A team selects their favorite language for server-side dev

## front-end dev

The frontend dev is more complex than the backend dev, due to a few tech are required at the same time. They are

- Html (tags like <html>, <input>, <p> and etc)
- CSS (control the style of everythin in a webpage, including color, font, border, and even animation)
- JS (javascript, the only programming language supported by all browsers. Use JS to control html, css, and UI logic.)
- static images (mostly a webpage may contain images. You have to handle with images not mater like it or not.)

Why front-end dev is not easy?

- diff browsers and diff versions of the same browser have different level to support features of Html, CSS and browser.
- nothing else I think

## major frameworks for frontend dev

the modern frameworks:

- [vue3](https://vuejs.org/)
- [react](https://react.dev/)
