# mk-learning-python
intro a learning path for python3. 

NOTE: learn python3 rather than python2 (out of date)

## two learning concepts
- Learn from easy to complex.

Learning easy tutorial first, then junior tutorial, finally advanced one.

- Example oriented learning.
  
For a section, try examples first and understand how & why. After that read other long chatty words.
